              <p>
                I have been an artist for as long as I could remember. Trying to
                make something unique has always been my goal. The results of my
                creations have been my constant motivation; something I could
                proudly say, "Yea, I created that!". Once I got introduced to
                coding, I was able to create anything with my knowledge of
                coding. It let me create my website, which led you here. It's
                exciting being able to create anything by coding, I wonder what
                we can create together!
